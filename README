## MBTA Speed Restriction Analysis

This project was created for my final assignment in my Computational Statistics course. In here, you may find a thorough
analysis of MBTA (Massachusetts Boston Transit Authority) speed restriction data during the year 2023. The project was
coded in RMarkdown format to provide an easy-to-read and accessible report for my findings.

## Overview

While overviews are generally reserved for the README file, it has been allocated in Main.Rmd to fulfill formatting
requirements for the assignment. The same applies for the dataset, source, and description.

## Installation

1. Install R and RStudio.
2. Install the packages required, using this code:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr))
```
3. Go to the main file, and access the graphs by clicking on the green play button, which will run the current chunk.
Note that if you run into any errors, you may need to load the previous chunks, which can be done by clicking the button
left of the run current chunk button.
